Foreign Trade Market Analysis and Segmentation
Project Overview
This project analyzes foreign trade market data using machine learning and data analytics techniques. The datasets include export and import records spanning several years, containing key variables such as HS codes, commodity descriptions, trade values, countries, and years. Our primary objective is to extract valuable insights on geographic trade patterns and commodity segments to better understand global trade dynamics.

Key Objectives
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and standardize the trade datasets to address missing values and ensure consistency across records.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Perform detailed analysis and visualization to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in the data.

Geographic Analysis:
Identify top trading partners by aggregating trade values, and analyze the balance between exports and imports for each country.

Commodity Segmentation:
Segment and rank the most traded commodities by total trade volume, highlighting which product categories drive the market.

Clustering and Segmentation:
Utilize clustering techniques to segment countries into distinct groups based on their trade volumes. This segmentation provides insights into major trade hubs, moderate players, and low-volume trade partners.

Methodology
Data Ingestion and Cleaning:

Load export and import CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
Handle missing values (e.g., filling missing trade values with zeros) and standardize data formats.
Feature Engineering:

Leverage existing features such as country, commodity, HS code, trade value, and year.
Create aggregate measures to summarize trade performance by country and commodity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate summary statistics and visualizations (line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps) to identify trends and relationships in the trade data.
Analyze temporal trends and variations across different years.
Geographic and Commodity Insights:

Compute the total export and import values for each country to identify key trade partners.
Aggregate trade values by commodity to determine the most significant product categories.
Clustering Analysis:

Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) on aggregated geographic data to segment countries based on their trade volumes.
Interpret clusters to distinguish between major trade hubs, moderate partners, and low-volume markets.
Outcomes
Trade Partner Insights:
Discover which countries are the leading export destinations and import sources, and analyze how these relationships evolve over time.

Commodity Trends:
Identify the top traded commodities and assess their contributions to overall trade. Insights from this analysis can inform strategies for market expansion and resource allocation.

Segmented Trade Patterns:
Using clustering analysis, the project segments countries into groups that reflect different trade dynamics. This segmentation provides a clearer picture of the global trade landscape.
